    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of garmam masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned. Transfer the browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir until the onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, 
            and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Mix the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt into the mixture.
            Return the chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce.
            Sprinkle the garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
            into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
    </ol>
